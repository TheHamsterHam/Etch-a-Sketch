It should include a the README.md;

1.Created a 16x16 grid at the start.
2.Set up a “hover” effect so that the grid divs change to the colour red.
3.Add a button to the top of the screen that will send the user a popup asking for the number of squares per side for the new grid. 
(Max set up to 50x50, so it looks nicer on the eyes)
